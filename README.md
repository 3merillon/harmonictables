# Harmonic Tables Visualization

## Overview

Welcome to the Harmonic Tables Visualization project! This interactive web application is designed to explore and visualize the Harmonic Tables for low prime numbers. It's a fun and educational tool to dive deep into the world of Relative Music Theory (RMT) and understand the fascinating relationships between natural harmonics and prime numbers.

## About Harmonic Tables

Harmonic Tables organize rational numbers into a visual structure, revealing the intricate relationships between numerators and denominators. Each prime number can be represented in such a table, showcasing the natural harmonics derived from a base wave division.


If you are interested in learning more about Relative Music Theory (RMT), which proposes defining a note's pitch relative to another note rather than choosing between fixed values..

## How to Use

The best way to navigate the Harmonic Tables Visualization is to click on planets, although you can also pan and zoom around. The navigation loading is flawed, and if you go too deep or insert a table, you can crash your browser or run out of memory. So, if you feel it slow down, you should probably give up.

## Future Plans

If time permits, I plan to improve and debug this project further. Enhancements might include optimizing the navigation, improving performance, and adding more features to make the exploration of Harmonic Tables even more engaging and informative.
